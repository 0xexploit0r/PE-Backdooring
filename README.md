## 🔷 My Introduction
Hi my name is Aryan, im a cyber security student, just a 17 year old kid who loves Hacking and Programming, i love RE | Malware Dev and Analysis | Game Hacking etc. 


## 🧪 Introduction to PE-Backdooring 

**What is PE** - *PE is (Portable Executable) an executable file format which you typically see in windows .exe .dll .scr*
**What is Backdoor** - *Backdoor or backdooring is a method used for getting unauthorized access to any computer. Basically You can control someones computer from your computer without them knowing about it.*

So Basic idea of this repo is to make you understand how any hacker can plant a backdoor in your daily use softwares, So if for example you play **Call Of Duty Warzone** every day or any other game like **Battlefield 6** 
hacker can convert your game's exe to a malware can hack you.
And also this is **how people get hacked when they download crack software or games**.

## 🔰 Generating a PE for Testing
Ok Now First we need a PE file to experiment on right? 

i made a simple messagebox program in C++ which we will backdoor
think of it like its a **Photoshop 2025 software**

---
⚙️ CODE:

    #include<Windows.h>
    
    int main(){
	    MessageBoxW(NULL,L"Photoshop.exe",L"Photoshop is now running",MB_OK);
	    return 0;
	   }

## ☠️ Generating A Shellcode(Malware)

Now we will make our payload basiclly with will give us the shell
but right now for testing we will make a shellcode to open calculator in windows


### 🔸 Step 1: Open msfconsole in kali linux or any other distro

### 🔸 Step 2: 
---
COMMAND:

 	//Opens msfconsole
	msfconsole

  	//Mention payload as Shellcode
  	use payload/windows/exec

 	//Set command with will execute
   	set CMD calc.exe

	//generate shellcode
 	generate -f raw -o shellocde.bin

---

### 🔸 Step 3: Download this bin file to your windows machine

## 💉 Planting Our Payload Inside The PE File.
So You've Came This Far huh?. GOOD!! now we execute last opreation i promise this is last one.


**We will need x32dbg for this and some basic assembly**

Open x32dbg and import the PE File


Find The Entry POINT


Copy address of Entry Point in notepad


Go to the Code Cave


Copy address of starting of code cave


Now Edit the first To Bytes of cove cave with pushad and push fd


paste the shellcode with hex editor

leave one null byte to tell PE where shellcode ends

now end with popad and popfd

now edit next null byte with the command of entry point

next byte will me the jmp to address of the next command after shellcode

patch your pe

run as admin
