## üî∑ My Introduction
Hi my name is Aryan, im a cyber security student, just a 17 year old kid who loves Hacking and Programming, i love RE | Malware Dev and Analysis | Game Hacking etc. 


## üß™ Introduction to PE-Backdooring 

**What is PE** - *PE is (Portable Executable) an executable file format which you typically see in windows .exe .dll .scr*
**What is Backdoor** - *Backdoor or backdooring is a method used for getting unauthorized access to any computer. Basically You can control someones computer from your computer without them knowing about it.*

So Basic idea of this repo is to make you understand how any hacker can plant a backdoor in your daily use softwares, So if for example you play **Call Of Duty Warzone** every day or any other game like **Battlefield 6** 
hacker can convert your game's exe to a malware can hack you.
